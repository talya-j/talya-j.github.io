		<p> 2/4/21 | Hello! This is my first journal entry. So far I've learned how to anchor tag other web pages to my own, how to stylize things to fit my aesthetic choices, and how to push my code onto the internet. The main thing that has been difficult for me so far has been being decisive. I've been having trouble coming up with a single comprehensive vision for what I want my website and codesketches to look like, so I'm going to try and be more chill about it, and see where my gut takes me.
		I'm enjoying coding, though. I'd done a bit for robotics here and there, but to be quite frank, all that coding was not nearly as enjoyable as this is. Coding in this class feels more personal than much else of what I do for other classes. Of course, it's not as if masses of people will be flocking to my website, but still, the act of making personal choices which display themselves on the internet (live) is a bit thrilling. Or maybe scary. Which is a hypocritical thing to say, when social media devours our lives.  </p>

		<p> 3/2/21 | OK, I am amazed that it is already March. Today I had a great lab with Ms. J, and in it we discussed my recent bad-fortune-teller codesketch. I'm going to try and summarize what my code for <a href = "bookfortunecodesketch.html"> this </a> specific project does here, in my journal. Alrighty. So first, I defined a few variables in javascript, linking them back to divs that I had already established in html. Then, I created an array called "sasiness" with all of my bad fortunes in it. My first function, "changeUp", begins by creating a variable of "randomNumber." randomNumber is generated by multiplying a random number (that exists within the realm of math) with my the length of my array of Sasiness, which is essentially the number of components that are held within sasiness, the number currently being 19. Then, this value is rounded (I think) when it is multiplied by Math.floor. Next, I created a new variable, "fortunetext", which is equal to a random string chosen from my array of sasiness. The final significant part of this function changes the inner text of my textbox, currently entitled "zoltar", to a string selected by fortune text. Outside of the function, I have a few event listeners which change zoltar's inner text when you click either on the larger page or the "turn page" pink box. </p>

		<p>  T2 Reflection - Talya J - 3/14/21  |  

To the best of my ability, here are some definitions of programming terms that we have learned so far in CS1: 

A variable is like a container that can hold certain values or strings—really anything that you want to put inside of it. 

An event listener is kind of like a little microphone or a sensor that we put onto certain parts of a website that can pick up different types of signals, such as a click, a hover, a specific key being pressed. 

A function is essentially an action that we can create in javascript and command it to perform. It actually helps me when I think about it similarly to functions in math. The structure of a function is: function () {}. Inside of the parentheses is the input of the function, so what we are performing this function on. Inside of the squiggly parentheses is the function itself—what exactly is happening when this action is run. 

CSS is a coding language, one that we can use in collaboration with HTML. I think that CSS is primarily used for determining the style of a given webpage. 

HTML is a triangle coding language that we use to create our websites. It is able to work in collaboration with CSS and Javascript. 

Javascript is another coding language, one that begins with far less known terms than HTML and CSS (I think). I think that Javascript is actually what enables our web pages to be interactive with viewers, instead of solely being words and colors on a screen. There is only a finite amount of already created content and terms in javascript, but we use what is already created to create our own words with their own meanings and actions. 

The console is essentially an active log which can let us know what is going on on our webpages. It is especially useful as we try to incorporate more action and javascript onto our web pages, because it is easier to determine what is happening and getting “logged” and what is not through utilizing the console. 

Terminal is, from my understanding, our gateway from typing in any coding application on our computers to actually connecting and interacting with the world wide web. We can use it to push our code onto the internet from files that are already stored locally, on our computers. 

I am still a bit confused about what Github is. I do think I have a solid enough understanding of how we use it, but I’m having difficulty putting into words what exactly it is. I think that Github is kind of a host service on the internet that we use to store or host our own repositories of code. 

Anyways, hope this reflection was helpful if anyone is reading this—I know I myself gained a clearer understanding of several of these terms through doing this :)

		<p> 4/11/21 | Hello there! This week I finished up my <a href="aguasDeBeber.html">agua de beber</a> codesketch. We were learning about keyframes animations, so this codeshetch tries to incorporate some animations. It was extremely janky at first, but I think I've smoothed it out some. I enjoyed adding the bits of ancient greek, on the agua de beber page and also on my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>. Next, I think I'm going to start working on a codesketch that will respond differently based on what mood the user selects that they are feeling. I think I'm going to make it bugs bunny related? That rabbit has been a nice fallback for me to be able to center my projects around when I'm unsure. Also, <a href="https://foxfier.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/that-song-bugs-sings-in-long-haired-hair/">this song</a> has actually been stuck in my head all week. Along with a mental image of bugs bunny playing the harp (with swagger). But yeah! All is well. I'm definitley getting more comfortable with simply setting up html pages and formatting them minimally to my liking. On a completely seperate note, it's April! The warmer weather has been such a blessing, and I'm really appreciating how much later the sun is setting. Perhaps spring isn't my least favorite season of the year.  </p>

		<p> 4/12/21 | Well, fancy meeting you here. This week I finished up my miscellaneous <a href="bugscodesketch.html">bugs bunny codesketch</a> and updated my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a> accordingly. I think I'm happy with how my finished version of it looks. I want to try and make more hidden-ish things around my website. (Which aren't truly hidden, of course, but are not front and center, ifykyk.) Oh, crazy—I'm going to see Ms. J for the first time (that I've been in her class) in person tomorrow! I'm quite jelly of Jasper, who perpetually is bumping into Molly around the Upper West Side. Also, I'm noticing that I've been less and less enthusiastic when writing in this journal. Monotony, I guess? So I will be trying to spice things up a bit, and my next entry will be written in the form of a formal, yet slightly cold 18th century letter of a woman living in the United Kingdom to her least favorite cousin. Goodbye, until then.

		<p>  Dearest Augustine,  </p>
		<p>My apologies, as it has been far too long since I have written to you last. This week, I have engaged with the tempestuous challenge of learning how to use the "for loop". But, after trouble, turbulation, and toil, I have come to a more complete understanding of these mystical for loops. Mine most recent <a href="forloopcodesketch.html">codesketch</a> does demonstrate my understanding. At their bare bones, for loops essentially are a way to create automatation within code, to make the computer to extra work for you, such as repeating things over and over again. Now, augustine, I know that you were never big on long-winded explanations, so I urge you to visid mine codesketch and explore, explore, explore! There is a secret code which must be deciphered, although I do doubt that you will be able to decode it. *sighs*  </p>
		<p>Cordially, </p>

		<p>  5/3/21 | Some definitions from class today: Arrays are lists of different items, which can be in many different forms. For loops are basically automatated repetitions of certain functions which you can dictate, making them repeat for a certain amount of times. Set interval determines the time between runs of a function. Math.random generates a random number between 0 and 1.  </p>

		<p>  5/17/21 | Hello! CS1 is unfortunately almost over :( but I think my presentation is steadily coming along. It is linked on my projects page now, and I actually really enjoyed putting it together. It was fun getting to make a presentation about what I worked on this year in CS1, and I think that's because I also enjoyed working on my codesketches this year. On another note, it is extremely warm out now. Perhaps it is short season? I think I am appreciating spring more right now than I ever have before because of the months and months that we were trapped inside. Also, I really want to learn Ancient Greek. I doubt my parents will let me, given that it is a dead language, but...we'll see. Oh! Also! I am taking Intro to Creative Writing this year, and we are required to compose a short story, and I started writing one and it is just WEIRD. It's about a kid who gets emotionally attached to a basket that they nap in, and I don't know where the desire to write this came from, but it just started pouring out. But yeah, overall, presentatons are probably going to be soon, and I'm excited! </p>

		<p> 5/24/21 | Testimonial/Reflection on CS1 </p>
		<p>Dear Augustine, </p>
		<p>Alas, my year in CS1 is soon to come to a close. What a time it has been. I have learned a plethora of new skills, which I will teach you, mine cousin, if you are lucky. How shall I sum up my experience in this celebrated course? In the words of Maurice Ravel, "The only love affair I have ever had was with music." I'd like to add on "...and Computer Science". I've learned a lot this year. Not a gram, not a few pounds, but at least a ton. I now know what functions are, what divs are, and how to set up basic websites with styling. I also have learned some of the basics of...drumroll please(!)...javascript! Oh, how jealous you must feel, Augustine! Perhaps it would be beneficial for you to take this class as well. I had a blast taking this class and getting to work on things that I personally like. As the kids say these days, I have deeply enjoyed getting to "nerd" out about topics which strike my fancy. Being able to apply these different things to my codesketches has been an absolute pleasure and made me extremely energized to buckle down and code, code, code! My Augustine, if I had to pass along just an iota of advice, it would be: labs! Make labs, enjoy labs, experience the labs, and you will be set for success, and have an enjoyable experience in CS1. Once again, the Dalton plan has proven to be successful. #makeHelenProud. And oh, my Augustine, how I've grown. (Not physically, although...I wish!) I feel ready to take on challenges that are thrown my way in the world of Computer Science, no matter what they are. With the internet at my side, I can accomplish anything, make anything, craft anything. Limited course structure in a hands-on way no longer intimidates me, I think. I can be the captain of my own ship (how a-boat that?). Although, at times during this class, I do think that slightly more structured assignments could have been helpful. That being said, I do understand that the balance between assignments and personal projects is a very difficult one to perfect, and this course did to a very good job with it this year. Additionally, one must take into account one of the unique and defining characteristics of this course—the fact that the students, the pupils themselves, are able to principally take their own educations by the reins, and trot, my cousin, trot! I hope to use this newfound skills to expand on my projects, and help bring them to life. I'd like to dive in headfirst to my interests, with my computer science skills at my side. I cannot wait to see what is to come, and additionally, what my peers shall "cook" up with all that they have learned in this course, also. Well, until next time! </p>
		<p>Extremely cordially, </p>
		<p>Talya </p>
